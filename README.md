# Customer-Complaint

         
         
         As a firm or any service providing company, we receive multiple complaints from customers.
         Receiving complaints is nothing but another way of improving our services towards the customer.
         In customer handling, it is of utmost importance to work towards customer satisfaction which 
         cannot be achieved untill and unless we address the complaints of our customer sincerely and
         efficiently. If we fail to solve or even address the complaints of our customers, they will be
         disappointed by our services and loose trust from us and hence we may loose them. So, addressing
         complaints is very crucial.
         
         This project takes a dig at a small dataset of a firm where customer complaints 
         along with other attributes are thoroughly analyzed and ML modeling is done for predicting
         which type of complaints are solved the most by the firm.
